## Getting Started
This tutorial will talk about a couple of things you should know before you begin using Winditor for the first time.

### Downloading Winditor
The "Latest Release" button at the top of this website will start a download of the most up-to-date version of Winditor. It will be in a typical ZIP file, which can be extracted in any way you wish.

### Setting Up

When you open Winditor, it should look like the image above. Before you start using it, there are two options that should be configured. Open the options menu by going to Tools -> Options in the menu bar:

#### The Options Menu

The options that we are interested are the first two:

* **Game Root**: This is the path to the folder containing the game's files, as extracted from Dolphin above. Any edits to maps are saved to this copy of the game, so it is recommended that this *not* be the only copy on your computer.
* **Dolphin**: This is the path to an installation of Dolphin 5.0. There is no known restriction on versions, but we recommend using the latest nightly version.

Setting both of these will allow you access to playtesting and any tools in the Tools menu.
