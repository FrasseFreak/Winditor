## Basics
This tutorial will go over the general features of Winditor and how to set it up for use.

## Main Window

When you download Winditor and open it up, you will be presented with the main window. This is where you will do most of your actor and collision editing. It is split into 4 main parts: the toolbars, the scene view, the viewport, and the mode panel.

### Toolbars

The toolbars contain various options and features that you can use while editing maps.

* File
  * Open
    * Stage: This will open a folder selection dialog, asking you to select a folder containing a map. Typically, you will be opening a folder within game's `Stage` directory, which is located at `files/res/Stage` in the ISO. When you select a folder, Winditor will open all the rooms contained within it. Opening all rooms at once can result in lag and potentially crash Winditor, so it is best to use the option below for large maps, such as the overworld map `sea`.
    * Rooms: This will open a file selection dialog, asking you to select one or more room archives to open. When you confirm the dialog, Winditor will open the selected rooms in addition to their Stage.arc, if one is present in the folder.
  * Save and Save As:
