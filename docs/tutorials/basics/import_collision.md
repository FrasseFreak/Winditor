The options are:
* **File**: This is where you will choose the file to import. Clicking on the "..." button to the right of the textbox will open a file chooser. Winditor supports *only* .dae files for collision meshes.
* **Scene**: Each Room in a map can have one collision mesh. This box allows you to choose which Room to import the chosen mesh into. Selecting a Room that already has a mesh will replace its mesh with the chosen one.
